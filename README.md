â€¢ Your assignment should be a Python program ,
Your assignment will use what we have learned so far
(e.g. conditional statements, array, array functions and array). 
, You can also use the internet as an additional source to help with your code.
For example, you may need some useful array functions, for example. 
Mix () if you use arrays to perform this task. 
However, there are many correct ways to write a plan. All roads lead to Rome.
